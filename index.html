        <h2>Itâ€™s time for Local 73 to hold elections now.</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past 3 years, our membership has endured incredible hardship
          due to leadership infighting, followed by a disastrous trusteeship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past year and a half, the trustees have failed to return power
          to their members or exercise leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of despair, members have felt compelled to file for
          decertification from the Local in record numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staff are fractionalized and are under constant strain from a lack
          of support from the trustees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trusteeship should be coming to an end, instead of preparing the
          membership for self governance, like they promised, the Trustees are
          trying to extend the trusteeship or merge our local with Local 1
          and/or HCII.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this in spite of the fact that Local 73 members have repeatedly
          demanded elections and have expressed their anger clearly in the past
          4 membership meetings in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unfortunate that the International Union and the Trustees are
          not listening.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these reasons, we have launched our slate and have sent a strong
          message to the International Union in a petition that this Union
          belongs to us. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We demand an election right now!
        </p>
