        <h2>It’s time for Local 73 to hold elections now!</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past 3 years, our membership has endured incredible hardship
          due to leadership infighting, followed by a disastrous trusteeship. In
          the past year and a half, the trustees have failed to return power to
          their members or exercise leadership.  Out of despair, members have
          felt compelled to file for decertification from the Local in record
          numbers. Staff are fractionalized and are under constant strain from a
          lack of support from the trustees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trusteeship should be coming to an end, instead of preparing the
          membership for self governance, like they promised, the Trustees are
          trying to extend the trusteeship or merge our local with Local 1
          and/or HCII.  All of this in spite of the fact that Local 73 members
          have repeatedly demanded elections and have expressed their anger
          clearly in the past 4 membership meetings in 2017. It is unfortunate
          that the International Union and the Trustees are not listening. For
          these reasons, we have launched our slate and have sent a strong
          message to the International Union in a petition that this Union
          belongs to us. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We demand an election right now!
